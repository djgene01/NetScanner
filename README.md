# NetScanner WIP

**NetScanner** is a lightweight tool built with **.NET 9** and **Terminal.GUI** to quickly scan local subnets for active devices, open ports, and even trace routes. Tired of hunting for IP addresses on your LAN? This might help!

## Key Features
- **Multithreaded Scanning**: Quickly scans an entire /24 subnet (~254 addresses) in about 15 seconds.
- **Traceroute Function**: Easily trace the path packets take from your machine to a target host.
- **Open Port Detection**: Specify which ports to check (e.g., 80, 443) to see if theyâ€™re open. Clickable URL
- **MAC address lookups**: Find a Mac on your network with ease

- **Future Enhancements**:
  - More features as inspiration strikes!

## Why This Tool?
Finding devices on a local network can be a chore. NetScanner is my personal solution to instantly discover:
- Which IPs are in use.
- Which services might be running on them.
- How network traffic travels across multiple hops (via Traceroute).

If it helps you, awesome!
