# NetScanner WIP

I got fedup with trying to find a device ip on a local lan. This tool will find devices in a given ip range and will also look for specified open ports. 

Planned features
Hyperlink click port 80 and 443 devices
Search for MAC address
Will add more as i think of it. This is meant as a personal tool but if you can make use of it great.
